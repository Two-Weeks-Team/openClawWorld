# Archived Map Files

**Status**: DEPRECATED - Do not use

These individual zone map files are archived and no longer in use.
The current map system uses a single unified map file: `grid_town_outdoor.json`

## Why Archived?

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All zones are now defined in one unified map file
2. **Simpler Sync**: One file to sync across server/client
3. **Consistent Data**: Zone boundaries, collision, and objects in one place

## Current Active Map

Use `../grid_town_outdoor.json` for all map-related work.
